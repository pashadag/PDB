This file contains a line for each run, with the value of delta, the insert size (the gap + 2*readlength) and l (the readlength).  
The value of k is always l - 1.
So, for example, the first line says that runhum1a.fa contains reads generated with delta=0, insert size 5000, read length 50, and k=49.
